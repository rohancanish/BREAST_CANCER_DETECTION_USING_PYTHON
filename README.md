# Breast Cancer Detection Using Python and Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build a Breast Cancer Detection model using Python and Machine Learning. The project aims to classify whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on the features derived from the cell nuclei present in a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohancanish/BREAST_CANCER_DETECTION_USING_PYTHON.git
cd BREAST_CANCER_DETECTION_USING_PYTHON
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the scripts to train the model and make predictions.

### Training the Model

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Making Predictions

After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

```bash
python predict.py --input <input_file>
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Features

The dataset contains 30 features computed from the digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses. These include:

- Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- And more...

### Target

The target variable indicates whether the tumor is:

- 0: Malignant
- 1: Benign

## Model Training

In this project, various machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the test data. You can find detailed performance metrics and visualizations in the `results` folder.
